# Data-Mining-and-Analytics-II
## About the Project
A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their landline business for cable competitors. The company needs to know which customers are leaving and attempt to mitigate continued customer loss. I have been hypothetically asked to analyze customer data to identify why customers are leaving and potential indicators to explain why those customers are leaving so the company can make an informed plan to mitigate further loss.

This repository contains a data mining report and data visualization to represent my findings of my data analysis.
