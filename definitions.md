 # Definitions
 - **Source data**: Information from any source in any format. 
 - **Analytic file**: A set of information items from (possibly) multiple sources; that information is composed into one row of information about some entity (e.g., a customer). 
 - **Record (aka case)**: One row in the analytic file. 
 - **Attribute**: An item of data that describes the record in some way. 
 - **Variable**: An attribute installed into a column (field) of the entity record. 
 - **Target variable**: A variable in the entity record to be predicted by the model.  
 - **Predictor variable**: A variable in the entity record that is a candidate for inclusion in the model as a predictor of the target variable. 
 - **Numeric variable**: A variable with only numbers in it; it is treated as a number.  
  - **Continuous numeric variable**: A number with decimal point in it, either real or implied. 
  - **Discrete numeric variable**: An integer, without a decimal point, real or implied. 
- **Categorical variable**: A variable with any character in it; the character may be a number, but it is treated as text. 
- **Dummy variable**: A variable created for each member of the list of possible contents of a categorical variable (e.g., “red,” “green,” and “blue”). 
- **Surrogate variable**: A variable that has an effect on the target variable very similar to that of another variable in the record.
